# Expense Tracker

This is my first React application. It was created whilst taking the [complete React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
It is a simple expense tracking web app that lets you input expenses, filter them and shows a chart with them.

## Technologies

-   HTML & CSS
-   React

## What I learned

Since this was my first React application I learned the basics of how React works.

- JSX
- Conditional content
- State management
- Vite deployment

## Biggest obstacle

I had no real obstacles, just the very begginings were a little rough.

## Possible extensions
